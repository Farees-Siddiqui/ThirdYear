- Visual communications: how we present visual information to human users
	- Videos, media, games, etc
- Storage, manipulation of displays and geometrical information
- You've all seen examples of computer graphics, its hard to miss in computer games, film, and other media
- Have you ever thought about how its produced
- This course will give an introdductory view to that
- interaction with visual information


## <font style = "color:#005b6d">Challenges</font>
- ### Photorealistic rendering:
	- The classic computer graphics problem
	- Can we produce an image that is as good as a camera (CG)
	- Even after 4 years of research there are still a few open problems
	- Can argue that we can now do better than a camera
	- Test: Display an image captured by a camera and an image produced by a computer on the same display and try to see if you can tell the difference
- ### Virtual Reality:
	- Can we produce a computer simulation that is as good as reality
	- About 3 decades of research, still many open problems
	- In a very small number of cases this is possible, depends upon your metric
	- Test: Can you tell the difference between an monitor and a window on the real world
- ### Real Time rendering:
	- How good of an image can we produce in real time?
	- This is vastly more difficult than the previous 2 challenges, since we cannot pre-compute
	- To get a real time effect we have to render at ~60 frames/second
- ### Visualization
	- Communicate as much information as possible to the human brain
	- We have sophisticated visual processing, our best sense, how can we take advantage of it?
	- Images are not realistic, but informative
